# Unredux

Cross-platform experimental microframework (500 lines of code + libraries!).

WIP. Highly unstable. Think [CycleJS](https://cycle.js.org/) without drivers built on [Kefir](https://kefirjs.github.io),
[Kefir.DB](https://github.com/ivan-kleshnin/kefir.db), and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
*(Name is a temporal placeholder).*

> I'm not happy about the imperative object-oriented approach VueJS and MobX promote. I'm not happy about
the bundle size of Angular and GraphQL. I'm not happy about the incidental complexity of Redux ecosystem.
As a freelancer, I want to concentrate on the business logic using a framework which code **one person**
can **read in one sitting**.

#### Features

* CycleJS-like architecture with sources and sinks but without drivers.
* Reactive dataflow with proactive insertions.
* Reactive state management (think Redux with functions instead of actions).
* Full-scale examples: realistic routing, SSR, etc.
* Declarative data fetching and auto-persistence (in progress).

Component model is as simple as possible (components are called apps here to differentiate them from
React components):

```js
function anyApp(sources, props) {
  sources      // {state$: streamOfStates, DOM: streamOfLocalDOMEvents, ...}
  ...          // -- your code --
  return sinks // {Component: reactComponent, action$: streamOfActions, ...}
}
```

where sources and sinks are records of streams (`Object <KefirStream>` speaking TypeScript), where keys
are predefined and correspond to event or effect types (a complex sentece but it describes everything
about the component model â€“ try to do that for another framework).

Component "composition" is just a function and stream composition, nothing fancy.

## Docs

* [Framework design comparison](./docs/frameworks.md)
* [Reactive or what?](./docs/reactive-or-what.md)
* [RxJS &rarr; Kefir](./docs/) (Why and How -- TODO)

Also suggested:

* [Kefir docs](kefirjs.github.io/kefir)

## Examples

#### [1. Counter](./examples/1.counter)

A basic example.

#### [2. Counters](./examples/2.counters)

Component isolation and reuse.

#### [3.1 Pages](./examples/3.1.pages)

Pages and simple routing.

#### [3.2 Router](./examples/3.2.router)

Advanced routing (**wip**).

#### [4. Todos](./examples/4.todos)

Classic "TodoMVC" app.

#### [5. Todos-History](./examples/5.todos-history)

Todos with a flexible history management.

#### [6. Shopping-Cart](./examples/6.shopping-cart)

Shopping Cart with interactions between "parent" and "child" apps.

#### [7.1 CRUD](./examples/7.1.crud)

CRUD client-server apps showing async data fetching, posting, caching, and more.

#### [7.2 CRUD-SSR](./examples/7.2.crud-ssr)

Previous example extended with SSR.

#### [8. DDL](./examples/8.ddl)

Declarative Data Load, lightweight alternative to **GraphQL+Relay** / **Falcor**.

**Notable differences**:
1. Unlike both (GraphQL / Falcor) it's REST API based (avoiding vendor lock-in on Backend).
2. It's more reactive and declarative where it makes sense with clear fallback paths.
3. Unlike GraphQL it relies on plain data to describe queries, instead of extra DSL layer.
4. Less magic, more boilerplate. Model dependencies are described, not auto-injected.
5. Much smaller code base and bundle size.
6. Validations and Querying are decoupled. Use TsIO, PropTypes, Tcomb or any other dynamic typing
to describe and validate your models. Avoiding vendor lock-in again.

## Usage

Examples are expected to work in Browser and NodeJS environments. The latter will require `babel-node`
(because of ES6 modules).

```
$ npm install babel-cli -g
$ npm install http-server -g
```

#### Browser

1. Fork and download the repo.
2. `$ npm install` in the root to pull common dependencies.
3. `$ cd <example_folder>`.
4. `$ npm install` to pull local example dependencies and symlink vendor libraries (see below).
5. `$ npm start` (check `package.json` scripts).

#### NodeJS

1. Create `some.js` file in the project root.
2. Run the file with `$ babel-node some.js`.
3. Required babel plugins and presets will be applied automatically.

### Prerequisites

* Functional Programming (basics)
* Lensing (basics)
* React (basics)
* Kefir (basics)

## Remarks

### Conventions

We use ASCII [marble diagrams](http://rxmarbles.com/):

```
observable: ---v1---v2---> (time)
```

where `v1` may denote a string `"v1"` or something else, which should be clear from a context.
