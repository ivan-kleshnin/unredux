### Types of state management

Passive PULL-PULL (passive input, passive output):

```js
let state = new State()
state.set(foo)        // pull input
let foo = state.get() // pull output
```

Hybrid PULL-PUSH (passive input, reactive output):

```js
let state = new State()

state.subscribe(doSomething) // push output: ==foo==bar==>

state.set(foo) // pull input
state.set(bar) //
```

Reactive PUSH-PUSH (reactive input, reactive output):

```js
let actions = O.of(foo, bar) // push input

let state = new State(actions)

state.subscribe(doSomething) // push output: ==foo==bar==>
```

#### Reactive view + Internal Hybrid state + Proactive actions

`Action => State <- View => Action`

* ReactJS (default approach)

```js
// View => Action
onClick = {() => handleAdd(2)}

// Action => State
function handleAdd(v) {
  state.over(["counter"], R.add(v))
  // or
  this.setState({counter: R.add(this.state.counter, v)})
}

// State <- View
// implicit DOM reconcilation
```

#### Reactive view + External Hybrid state (no explicit actions)

`State <- View => State`

* Angular
* CalmmJS
* MobX (default approach)
* Flux (default approach)
* Redux (default approach)
* VueJS
* (... thousands of them)

```js
// View => Action
onClick = {() => state.over("counter", R.add(2))}

// State <- View
// implicit DOM reconcilation
```

#### Reactive view + Reactive state + Proactive actions

`Action <- State <- View => Action`

* Cycle-React
* Earlier versions of this project

```js
// View => Action
onClick = {() => actions.add(2)}

// Action <- State
let state = State(0, O.merge(
  actions.inc,
  actions.add,
  // ...
))

// State <- View
// implicit DOM reconcilation
```

#### Reactive view + Reactive state + Reactive actions

`Intent <- State <- View <- Intent`

* CycleJS
* Unredux
* *(Not aware of other examples)*

```js
// View <- Intent
let intents = {
  inc: DOM.fromKey("inc").listen("click"),
  dec: DOM.fromKey("dec").listen("click"),
}

// Intent <- State
let state = State(0, O.merge(
  intents.inc(_ => R.inc),
  intents.add(v => R.add(v)),
  // ...
))

// State <- View
// implicit DOM reconcilation
```

## Subjective overview

### [Cycle-React](https://github.com/pH200/cycle-react)

Cycle-React = vanilla React + some streaming facilities.

* Pros: no extra concepts, interoperability with vanilla React ecosystem
* Cons: [imperative](https://github.com/pH200/cycle-react/blob/master/examples/web/todomvc/todo-model.js#L22) state updates,
[imperative](https://github.com/pH200/cycle-react/blob/master/examples/web/todomvc/todo-view.js#L57-L64) actions/intents.

### [CalmmJS](https://github.com/calmm-js)

Redux-like.

* Pros: allows multiple stores.
* Cons: obscure non-loggable actions, a lot of magic.

### [CycleJS](https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs/)

The design of Unredux is heavily inspired by CycleJS. Both projects introduce the newer reactive
component concept (called dataflow nodes in CycleJS and components or apps here) instead of attempting
to patch React or something. I think CycleJS is based on two great and one bad ideas. The great ideas
are: reactive dataflow and isolation approach. The bad idea is: drivers.

I believe the *driver* concept, like it's present in CycleJS, is fundamentally broken. CycleJS drivers are
said to "remove side effects from your code". And they really do that, but not in the sense you want.

* Haskell(-like) + "do" syntax: *write code that looks like imperative, but is actually pure*.
* CycleJS + drivers: *write code that looks like pure, but is actually imperative*.

And no, this is not caused by monad/stream distinction. This is a design difference.

Haskell approach is very grounded: side effects are sequential by nature so it's convenient to express
them so. Meanwhile we don't want to break the language purity, so we express effects as functions under
the carpet. For example, effectful function may have a type like `a -> RealWorld -> (b, RealWorld)` and
be called like

```hs
do {
  x1 <- doThis
  x2 <- doThat
}
```

Note that you not only express (natural) sequences in a convenient imperative syntax, but also accumulate the action
results in scope! Both of these features are missing in CycleJS.

CycleJS' approach allows you to isolate side-effects in the library code so you can test your app
without mocking. Sounds good, but the huge drawback is that you can no longer express effectful
sequences sequentially. It's trivial to make a one-off side effect and DOM stuff is mostly like that.
It's hard to express two sequential effects (think optimistic updates affecting STATE and SERVER)
and HTTP stuff is mostly like that. In pseudo-code:

```
make doThis
on response of doThis
  make doThat
on response of doThat
  end

on make of doThis
  request doThis
on make of doThat
  request doThat
```

And you can imagine the mess happening with 3+ steps... This is a "callback hell" on a new level.

I wonder why CycleJS community is so concerned about drivers. Most drivers, with a few exceptions,
incapsulate fairly trivial code. They simply can't take complex premises to do something more useful
than hiding subscription lines except for DOM where sinks of effects has a single form of "render that"
(in simplest case, ater on you'll be screwed by non-incapsulable animations). The fact is: the IO layer
is often **less** predictable than Logic layer, so it's not a benefit to have 2nd class side-effects in your framework.

Going further, anything with 2+ effect types can't be exressed as driver, and will be classified as...
middleware? Nothing of that is even mentioned in the docs. `cycle-onionify` and `isolate` are
"secret" examples of middlewares but YOU aren't expected to write one.

Now state management is the biggest unsolved frontend topic since 2014 and it is all about multiple
effect sources and targets: memory, localStorage, REST, etc. CycleJS is not prepared to them "by design"

*TODO describe the lack of lifecycle events in CycleJS*

Our decision is to ditch the drivers completely. When it's about *harder unit testing* vs *harder development*
choice you should always choose the first. The benefit of unit tests is overrated, the pain and cost
of messy development are underrated. CycleJS will force you to manually marshal N+ effectful streams
from your components. And, without a compiler help, it's not trivial at all (TypeScript won't help
you because effects are still untyped).

In Unredux, most components will have 1 or 2 streams: `$ (state-action)` (like in Cycle-Onionify)
and `DOM` (like in basic CycleJS). HTTP, logging, etc are kept inside the components. Their
resources can still be handled and properly released via `DOM` stream or React lifecycle events.

We don't support the claim that "imperative is bad, so non-reactive as imperative in time is also bad".
We think imperative syntax is the best to express sequential side effects (Ruby and Go dominate devops
for a reason) so non-reactive, control paradigm totally has it's place in code.

DOM read-writes are very different from HTTP request-responses because in the first case the app
is the passive part, the receiver, and in the second case the app is the active part, the initiator.
We think that expressing both in the same way is conceptually wrong. Active part is modelled the
best as Controller and passive part is modelled the best as Reactor. With our approach, we keep
**reactivity** where it fits the best (DOM + DOM events) and **control** where it fits the best
(HTTP + optimistic updates).

#### Update

Many CycleJS drivers rely on side-effects in `main`:

**[CycleDOM](https://cycle.js.org/api/dom.html)**

```js
function main(sources) {
  DOMSource.select('input').events('keydown', { // side-effect!
    preventDefault: true
  })

  ...
}
```

**[Cyclic-Router](https://github.com/cyclejs-community/cyclic-router)**

```js
function main(sources) {
  const match$ = sources.router.define({ // side-effect!
    '/': HomeComponent,
    '/other': OtherComponent
  });

  ...
}
```

Just a few picks of many... Which proves that `main` won't be a pure function in most CycleJS apps,
so why bother with drivers?! There actually were quite a few [discussions](https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs/issues/)
about common terms redefined in CycleJS. The argument of "our own vision" prevailed.
